Hello!! Universifight is a PyGame RPG game, heavily based on the game "Darkest Dungeon" and features turn-based combat as well as a medieval theme and story. Music is taken by "Skyrim" as well as some other creators while most backgrounds in the game where taken from the internet and Darkest Dungeon.

The game was created from a starter ["Final Fantasy" PyGame code found in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlolidaoiak&list=PLjcN1EyupaQnvpv61iriF8Ax9dKra-MhZ). All the assets in the game including **character sprites, enemies, face icons, camp, final ending screen, icons** (except from the potion, sword icon and the chest assets), where made by me with IbisPaintX!!
